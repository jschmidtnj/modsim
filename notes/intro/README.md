# intro

- stochastic vs deterministic system
  - stochastic = if there is some random variable in the state
- continuous vs discrete = if the state changes at fixed times (someone entering or leaving)
  - there is a specific time at which the state variable changes
- dynamic system = cannot look at a snapshot to view performance - need to see the whole thing
  - static = coin flip (you can look at a snapshot and not gain any information from looking at the whole thing). it's memoryless
- server - schedule a departure event -> when starting service, as a result of an arrival or departure
- arrival = type 1, departure = type 2
- FEL = future event list
